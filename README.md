### description: 
#### I got S&P500 stock prices for every minutes in 8 years(2010-2018) in a CSV file and i'm trying to understand when statistically in a day time, and in a year time is better to buy.
#### For now I organized data and made a dictionary(python) {"9:30 PM" : "450"} with the (hour as a key) and (how many times that hour was the highest price of the day as a value). Turns out 6 PM is the highest price almost always for the S&P ðŸ˜…â€‹.
#### It is possible to set the dict key to have minutes precision or hour precision just by changing a variable in the code, there is a #comment near it 
"I'm concerned i'm reinventing the wheel"
### TODO
#### I would like to add some features, open to any idea. Maybe a site with graphs.
